  <b>4.6</b> Any content you upload to the App will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary and you grant us a perpetual irrevocable licence to use, copy, distribute, amend and/or disclose to third parties any such content for any purpose.<br>

</p>
   <br> <br>
<h4>5.   MAKING A RESERVATION</h4>
 <p><b>5.1</b>
 All Reservations must be placed via the App. You can make a Reservation by selecting the service that you want and following the on-screen process.  You must use a GPS enabled device to make a Reservation and it is your responsibility to ensure that your device is compatible with the App.  We will not be responsible for any malfunction of your device. <br>
<b>5.2</b> Your Reservation forms an acceptance of our offer to provide the Reservation Services and creates a legally binding agreement between you and us, governed by these terms.  You acknowledge that we do not provide the Ride you receive and your Ride is provided by the Travel Provider only.<br>
<b>5.3</b> Once you make a Reservation, we will accept the Reservation and connect you with Travel Providers.  Once successfully connected to a Travel Provider, you will receive an in-App notification confirming your Reservation along with an estimated arrival time of the Travel Provider and charges.   <br>
</p>
 <br> <br>
<h4>6.   OUR SERVICES</h4>
<p>
<b>6.1</b> Once you successfully make a Reservation you must ensure that you are ready to begin your Ride and you are at the agreed pick up location for your Travel Provider.  It will be your responsibility to ensure that the Travel Provider can pick you up at the estimated agreed time. If the Travel Provider arrives at your location and is unable to provide the Ride at all or is delayed, then you may be charged a reasonable fee to cover wasted costs (as detailed in paragraph 11).<br>
<b>6.2</b> The Reservation Services are provided for you to reserve Rides for yourself and, where relevant, friends and family who you want to accompany you on your Ride. If somebody else wishes to take a Ride without you, we strongly recommend that they use (or sign up for) their own account and make a Reservation in their own name. If you do agree to use the Reservation Services to make a Reservation for someone else, our agreement will still be with you and you will still be fully responsible for fulfilling all of your obligations in respect of the Reservation Services we provide to you<br>
<b>6.3</b> You must not:<br>
<b>• 6.3.1 </b> use the Reservation Services to make a Reservation for a person who is under the age of 18, unless that person is accompanied by at least one person who is over the age of 18; or<br>
<b>• 6.3.2 </b>  give any other person access to your account to place Reservations themselves. <br>
<b>6.4</b> Any times that we provide in relation to the performance of the Reservation Services are estimates only.    <br>
<b>6.5</b> Occasionally our ability to provide the Reservation Services may be affected by an event outside our control. In this case we will make reasonable efforts to provide the services despite the occurrence of the event.  Where the event causes a delay to our performance of the services, we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. If however the event prevents us from providing the services at all or within a reasonable period of the date on which it was originally anticipated the Reservation Services would be provided then we may cancel this contract and provide you with a full refund (or, if only part of the Reservation Services was affected, a refund for the affected part of the Reservation Services).<br>
</p>
 <br> <br>
<h4>7.  DURATION OF THE RESERVATION </h4>
<p>
<b>7.1</b> The duration of Reservation will commence once the Reservation is confirmed and you will receive the following information via the App:<br>
<b>• 7.1.1 </b> the Travel Provider’s first name;<br>
<b>• 7.1.2 </b> the Travel Provider’s photograph; <br>
<b>• 7.1.3 </b> the Travel Provider’s London PHV licence number;<br>
<b>• 7.1.4 </b> the Travel Provider’s vehicle registration mark and vehicle type; <br>
<b>• 7.1.5 </b> our contact number;<br>
<b>• 7.1.6 </b> the estimated cost of the Ride; and  <br>
<b>• 7.1.7 </b> an estimated time of arrival of the Travel Provider.<br>

<b>7.2</b> The Reservation will end once the Ride has completed.  If you would like to make a Reservation again in future, please place a further order via the App<br>
<b>7.3</b> You acknowledge that after the Ride has completed the Travel Provider will be prompted to provide feedback regarding you via a rating system (your “Score”).  This Score will only be used by us to enhance your Ride experience and for any loyalty or promotional bonus we may offer.<br>
</p>
 <br> <br>
<h4>8.  CHANGES TO THE RESERVATION SERVICES</h4>
<p>
<b>8.1 Making changes </b><br>
We may from time to time change our Reservation Services to better meet customer demand, take account of changes in the market, reflect changes in the law or for any other reason.
<br>
<b>8.2  Changes affecting our services</b><br>
Where we cannot continue to provide the Reservation Services to you as originally ordered, for example because a change in law makes it unlawful for us to do so or because it would be practically or commercially unviable for us to continue providing the previous version of the service to you, we will let you know.
</p>
<br><br>
<h4>9.   PRICE AND PAYMENT</h4>
<p>
<b>9.1</b> The App is free to download from the Apple App store or Google Play store.  Reservation Services are provided to you free of charge via the App.  You acknowledge that the Ride you receive via use of the Reservation Services may incur a charge from the Travel Provider. <br>
<b>9.2</b> The rates that apply for a Ride will be provided to you via the App.  The estimated price of a Ride (calculated based on distance, time and traffic conditions) (which includes VAT) (the “Price”) is shown on the App when making a Reservation.  <br>
<b>9.3</b> We take all reasonable care to ensure that the estimated Price indicated to you is correct.  You will receive an in-App notification and email at the completion of the Ride regarding the final Price.  Payment of the Price is due immediately upon completion of a Ride.  <br>
<b>9.4</b> We facilitate payment of the Price on behalf of the Travel Provider as their agent.  Your payment will be by the nominated method chosen by you during Account Registration.  Travel Providers do not accept cash payments or tips.  Acting as the Travel Provider’s agent, if we are unable to take payment for any reason we will contact you and ask you to make payment by an alternative method.<br>
<b>9.5</b> You acknowledge that we may revise the Price due to periods of high demand but we will inform you of any increases to the Price before you confirm the Reservation.  You have the right to refuse to agree to the revision to the Price and not proceed with the Reservation. <br>
<b>9.6</b> We may provide you with promotional codes or discounts based on different events and your Score which may affect the Price.  However, we will inform you of any changes to the Price as a result of those promotional codes or Score before you make a Reservation. <br>
</p>
 <br> <br>
 <h4>10.   OTHER FEES</h4>
<p>
<b>10.1</b> After making a Reservation, you may cancel it through the App but you may incur a cancellation fee as detailed in paragraph 12. You may also be charged if you are not at the agreed location your Travel Provider is sent to.  <br>
<b>10.2</b> You shall be responsible for any costs required for repair to or additional valet services required by the Travel Provider where you have materially damaged or stained their vehicle during your Ride.  <br>
<b>10.3</b> We will facilitate the payment of those costs on behalf of the Travel Provider via your payment method and those costs will be passed on in full to the Travel Provider<br>
<b>10.4</b> The Reservation Services can only be used by individuals of at least 18 years of age who are resident in the United Kingdom and legally entitled to enter into contracts. If we have previously cancelled the provision of any service to you, please let us know before you order further services from us.<br>
</p>
 <br> <br>
 <h4>11.  CANCELLATION BY YOU</h4>
<p>
<b>11.1 Cancellation soon after making a Reservation </b><br>
  You have the right to cancel the contract with the Travel Provider after a Reservation is confirmed and prior to the arrival of the Travel Provider without giving any reason. To do so you must inform us by a clear statement by selecting the “Cancel Ride” option within the App and confirm.  This may result in a cancellation charge as follows:<br>
<b>• 11.1.1 </b> If you cancel within 2 minutes of making a Reservation - no charge; and<br>
<b>• 11.1.2 </b> If you cancel after 2 minutes of making a Reservation – £5 charge. <br>
<b>11.2</b> The cancellation charge is to reflect the time and expenses incurred by Travel Providers to get to your location.  Once the Travel Provider arrives you will receive a notification via the App.  If the Travel Provider arrives late (being 5 minutes over the estimated time of arrival notified to you when the Reservation is confirmed) then we will waive any cancellation charge, if you wish to cancel before the Travel Provider arrives. <br>
<b>11.3 Cancellation if there is a problem with the Ride</b> <br>
Once you have commenced a Ride you may inform the Travel Provider that you wish to cancel the Ride and the Travel Provider will drop you off.  You will be charged the Price of the Ride up until that point.
<br>
<b>11.4 Cancellation for any other reason</b> <br>
Paragraphs 11.1 to 11.4 describe the cancellation rights that we offer and we will generally not be able to accept the cancellation of your order other than in the circumstances described in those paragraphs. However, nothing in these terms is intended to override your ordinary legal rights.<br>
</p>
 <br> <br>
 <h4>12.    OUR RIGHTS TO CANCEL YOUR RESERVATION </h4>
<p>
<b>12.1</b>  Once a Reservation has been confirmed and the Travel Provider is on its way to you we cannot cancel the Reservation.  However, the Travel Provider can cancel in the following circumstances and you may incur a cancellation charge:<br>
<b>• 12.1.1 </b> if the Travel Provider cannot get in touch with you or you cannot confirm your location (for whatever reason) - no charge; and <br>
<b>• 12.1.2 </b> if you do not show up at the agreed pick up location within 5 minutes of the Travel Provider arriving - £5 charge. <br>
</p>
 <br> <br>
 <h4>13.    OUR RIGHTS TO END THE CONTRACT</h4>
<p>
<b>13.1 Ending the contract due to your breach</b> <br>
We may cancel the contract and stop providing the Reservation Services in the following circumstances:<br>
<b>• 13.1.1 </b> where you are not eligible to receive the Reservation Services, for example because you are not resident in the United Kingdom;<br>
<b>• 13.1.2 </b> where we have reasonable grounds to believe that you will not make payment at the required time;<br>
<b>• 13.1.3 </b> where we do not have sufficient capacity to provide the Reservation Services to you; <br>
<b>• 13.1.4 </b> if you fail to comply with these terms in a way that has a serious effect on us; or<br>
<b>• 13.1.5 </b> if we discover that you gave us incorrect information when you completed your Account Registration. <br>
<b>13.2 Ending the contract for other reasons</b> <br>
<b>• 13.2.1 </b> We may end this contract if an event outside our control happens which means that we cannot provide the services as expected (see paragraph 6).<br>
<b>• 13.2.2 </b> We may also cancel the contract at any time on not less than 14 days’ written notice to you at any time. In this case we will stop providing the services, and our contract with you will end, from the end of that period.<br>

<br>
However, nothing in this paragraph 14.10 or otherwise in these terms is intended to limit or exclude our liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, for breach of your legal rights in relation to the services or otherwise where we are not permitted to limit or exclude our liability by law.<br>
