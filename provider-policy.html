</p>
 <br> <br>
<h4>3. ABOUT YOU</h4>

<b>3.3</b>  You acknowledge that we do not provide taxi/chauffeur services which are only provided by you.

<b>• 3.5.6 </b>     you have completed all criminal check and Disclosure and Barring Service checks within the last 90 days of Registration and have submitted these to us (if your those checks, as part of your PCO licence application process, were not within the past 90 days we will arrange for these to be undertaken at our expense); and  <br>
<b>• 3.5.7 </b> you have suffered no serious medical issues since your medical check performed as part of the granting of your PCO licence.  <br>
<b>3.6</b>  You acknowledge that you are an independent contractor and nothing in this contract shall render you an employee, worker, agent or partner of us and you shall not hold yourself out as such.<br>

</p>
 <br> <br>
<h4>4. ACCESSING THE APP</h4>
<p>
<b>4.1</b>  Access to the App is permitted when available and we will not be liable if for any reason our App is unavailable, in whole or in part, for any reason, at any time or for any period.<br>
<b>4.2</b> All information, including your User Number and password or any other piece of information provided as part of our security procedures and (“<b>Identifying Information</b>”), you must treat as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any third party. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorised use of the Identifying Information, or any other breach of security. <br>
<b>4.3</b> You are responsible for all activity that occurs using the Identifying Information issued to you and you may be held liable for losses incurred by you, us or any other user of or visitor to the App due to any use connected with your Identifying Information, whether or not that use has been made by you. <br>
<b>4.4</b>  We have the right to disable your rights of access to all or parts of the App, at our sole discretion, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these terms.<br>
<b>4.5</b> Any content you upload to the App will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary and you grant us a perpetual irrevocable licence to use, copy, distribute, amend and/or disclose to third parties any such content for any purpose. <br>
<b>4.6</b> We may suspend your use of the App in circumstances where we are of the opinion that your continued use of the App would cause us liability, would cause us to breach any law, or endangers our systems. We shall not be liable to you in respect of any such suspension<br>

</p>
   <br> <br>
<h4>5.  YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES </h4>
 <p><b>5.1</b>
Once you have received your User Number, you can then log on to the App using the User Number and a passcode (chosen by you) and will be enabled to access all of the Services on the App.  <br>
<b>5.2</b> You must use a GPS enabled device to use the Services and it is your responsibility to ensure that your device is compatible with the App.  We will not be responsible for any malfunction of your device and we do not provide you with any type of device.  We recommend that you use a device with an unlimited or high mobile data plan. <br>
<b>5.3</b> You are under no obligation to log on to the App at any particular time or for any minimum period.  Once you have logged onto the App you will begin to receive the Services and we will send bookings by Riders to you (a “<b>Ride Request</b>”).  The Ride Request will inform you the distance to the Rider pick up location and the duration of your journey there.  You are under no obligation to accept Ride Requests at any time or to accept a minimum number of Ride Requests.  It is entirely your discretion to accept a Ride Request by clicking the “accept Ride Request” function on the App or to decline or ignore Ride Requests.  <br>
<b>5.4</b> Once you have accepted the Ride Request you will receive certain other information about the Rider, such as their first name and photograph.  You acknowledge that the Rider will then receive the following information about you, being your: <br>
<b>• 5.4.1 </b>  first name; <br>
<b>• 5.4.2 </b>  photograph;<br>
<b>• 5.4.3 </b> London PHV licence number; <br>
<b>• 5.4.4 </b>  vehicle registration mark and vehicle type; <br>
<b>• 5.4.5 </b>  estimated cost of the Ride; and<br>
<b>• 5.4.6 </b>   estimated time of arrival at the pick up location. <br>
<b>5.5</b> Once you arrive at the pick up location the Rider will receive a push notification informing them that you have arrived.  We recommend that you wait at least 5 minutes from that time for the Rider to arrive at your PHV (note you may begin charging a late Rider after 2 minutes waiting time, see paragraph 14 below).   <br>
<b>5.6</b> You may contact a Rider using the function via the App to inform them you are waiting.  However, you agree that you will not request a Rider’s personal details or contact a Rider for any reason other than to begin the Ride.  <br>
<b>5.7</b>  Once the Rider is safely in your PHV you may commence the journey by clicking the "Start Ride" function on the App and you will be notified of the Rider’s destination.  This commences the Ride and you agree that this creates a legally binding agreement between you and the Rider.  You acknowledge that we do not provide the Ride and it is your obligation to the Rider to complete the Ride in the most safe, efficient and professional way.       <br>
<b>5.8</b> You must not (unless specifically requested by the Rider) allow other persons into your PHV for the Ride.   <br>
<b>5.9</b>  The route that you take to the destination is a matter for your professional discretion, taking account of your knowledge of the area and your driving experience.  You should treat each Rider fairly and (unless the Rider specifically requests otherwise) use the fastest or most efficient route.  The App may recommend a route but we provide no guarantee that this is the fastest or most efficient route.  You may use alternative apps or devices to help you plan your route, or take account of suggestions made by the Rider, but you agree to be ultimately responsible for choosing the route and not to rely on us, the Rider or any app or device in doing so.  <br>
<b>5.10</b>   You acknowledge and agree that you shall not provide any number of Rides in a Saturday to Friday period (a “<b>Week</b>”) in excess of 60 hours per Week.  Access to the App will be restricted if you have made 60 hours of Rides in a Week and continuous completion of Rides up to this limit will result in immediate cancellation of access to the Services on the App.     <br>
</p>
 <br> <br>
<h4>6.  YOUR AVAILABILITY </h4>
<p>
<b>6.1</b> You are not required to be available at any given time to use the Services, to log on to the App and provide Rides.  You may log on and off the App as desired.  Further, once you are logged onto the App, you are under no requirement to accept a minimum number of Ride Requests and there is no penalisation for rejection by you of Ride Requests. <br>
<b>6.2</b> We agree that you are not required to exclusively use the App and you have the right to (when both logged on and off the App) use other app based or traditional taxi services using your PHV.  You have the right to engage in other business activities, provided that doing so does not place you in breach of your agreement with us or with the Rider.<br>

</p>
 <br> <br>
<h4>7.  OUR SERVICES </h4>
<p>
<b>7.1</b>  Occasionally our ability to provide the Services may be affected by an event outside our control. In this case we will make reasonable efforts to provide the Services despite the occurrence of the event. Where the event causes a delay to our performance of the Services, we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. If however the event prevents us from providing the Services at all or within a reasonable period of the date on which it was originally anticipated the Services would be provided then we may cancel this contract and provide you with a full refund (or, if only part of the Services were affected, a refund for the affected part of the Services).<br>
</p>
 <br> <br>
<h4>8.  DURING THE RIDE </h4>
<p>
<b>8.1</b> You agree that you shall hold and maintain the documentation required to provide a Ride (detailed in paragraph 3.5 to 3.7) at all times and inform us immediately of any changes (including renewals and updates) to those documents.  Failure to do so will result in immediate cancellation of access to the Services on the App.
<br>
<b>8.2 </b> You acknowledge that:<br>
<b>• 8.2.1 </b>  you shall provide the Ride using all the highest standards of skill and professionalism; <br>
<b>• 8.2.2 </b>  you are at all times medically fit to drive and shall not drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs; <br>
<b>• 8.2.3 </b>  your PHV remains owned by you and is suitable to provide any Rides;<br>
<b>• 8.2.4 </b>  your PHV is kept in an clean condition (both inside and out); and<br>
<b>• 8.2.5 </b>  your PHV is maintained mechanically and safely to an optimum condition required to perform a Ride.    <br>

</p>
<br><br>
<h4>9.  AFTER THE RIDE</h4>
<p>
<b>9.1</b> You acknowledge that following the Ride the Rider will be prompted to rate the travel service they have received and provide any feedback.  This will provide your score (“<b>Score</b>”).  We expect that you provide the Ride according to these Terms and recommend you adhere to the standards set out in paragraph 8.2.  We will not share your Score with third parties.   <br>
<b>9.2</b>  We will send you a monthly report regarding your Score (“<b>Score Report</b>”).  You agree that you shall provide the Rides in accordance with the standards in paragraph 8.2 in order to achieve and maintain a high Score.  Should you consistently provide a poor service which is reflected by a poor Score in your Score Report we reserve the right to terminate this contract.   <br>
<b>9.3</b> Likewise you will be prompted to rate the Rider on their behaviour during a Ride.  The Rider’s score will be linked to promotional and loyalty codes so we ask that you rate Riders reasonably and in good faith.     <br>
</p>
 <br> <br>
 <h4>10.  CHANGES TO THE SERVICES</h4>
<p>
<b>10.1   Making changes</b><br>
We may from time to time change our Services to better meet customer demand, take account of changes in the market, reflect changes in the law or for any other reason.<br>
<b>10.2    Changes affecting our Services</b><br>
Where we cannot continue to provide the Services to you as originally engaged with on the App, for example because a change in law makes it unlawful for us to do so or because it would be practically or commercially unviable for us to continue providing the previous version of the service to you, we will let you know.<br>

</p>
 <br> <br>
 <h4>11.    PRICE AND PAYMENT</h4>
<p>
<b>11.1</b>    The App is free to download from the Apple App store or Google Play store.<br>
<b>11.2   </b> You can charge a fare for each Ride you provide to a Rider which you have received via the Services (a “<b>Charge</b>”). <br>
<b>11.3  </b>  The estimated Charge (calculated based on a base charge, distance, time and traffic conditions) is shown to you on the App (and to the Rider) when accepting a Ride Request.  You will be informed of the calculation of base charges on the App.  We take all reasonable care to ensure that the estimated Charge indicated to you is correct.  However you acknowledge that this may change due to traffic and duration changes during the Ride.  Charges may also change during periods of high demand. The final Charge will be sent to you on completion of the Ride.  <br>
<b>11.4  </b>  In consideration for our provision of the Services to you, you agree to pay us a payment (“<b>Services Payment</b>") calculated based on each Ride and a percentage of the Charge for that Ride. <br>
<b>11.5   </b> The Services Payment is currently 15% (plus the prevailing rate of VAT at the time) but you acknowledge that we reserve the right to amend this percentage at any time due to any regulatory or market factors.  We will provide you with 7 days’ notice of any change to the Services Payment.<br>
<b>11.6   </b> We facilitate payment of the Charge via the App on your behalf as your agent.  We shall transfer you all Charges (including Cancellation Charges, see paragraphs 13 and 14) collected in cleared funds from Riders (less the Services Payment) to you each Tuesday in regard to those Charges for the preceding Week. <br>
<b>11.7    </b>If a Rider disputes any Charge amount, we will withhold payment in relation to that Charge until the matter is resolved. <br>
<b>11.8  </b>  You acknowledge that the Charge is the only payment you will receive for the Ride.  You may not agree a higher or lower Charge with the Rider.  All payments must be made by the Rider through their own account on the Rider app and you cannot accept cash payments or tips.<br>
<b>11.9  </b>  After the completion of a Ride we will send you an invoice showing the Ride route, the duration of the Ride, the Charge and the Services Payment owed.<br>

</p>
 <br> <br>
 <h4>12.    OTHER FEES</h4>
<p>
<b>12.1 </b>  You may be entitled to other cancellation fees where a Rider cancels a Ride.  Please see paragraphs 13 and 14 below.<br>
<b>12.2  </b>  You shall be responsible for the general upkeep and cleaning of your PHV.  However, where a Rider has materially damaged or stained your PHV during a Ride you may charge for costs required for repair to or additional valet services
 for your PHV.<br>
<b>12.3  </b>  We require you to send evidence (such as photos and receipts) of those costs to us via the App and we will aim to facilitate the payment of those reasonable costs to you. <br>

</p>
 <br> <br>
 <h4>13.    CANCELLATION BY A RIDER</h4>
<p>
<b>13.1</b> A Rider may cancel the Ride prior to your arrival without giving any reason.  This may result in a cancellation charge (“<b>Cancellation Charge</b>”) to the Rider as follows: <br>

<b>• 13.1.1 </b> If a Rider cancels within 2 minutes of confirming the Ride - no Cancellation Charge; <br>
<b>• 13.1.2 </b> If a Rider cancels after 2 minutes of confirming the Ride – £5 Cancellation Charge; or <br>
<b>• 13.1.3 </b> If a Rider cancels during the Ride - the Charge will be the cost of the Ride up until that point. <br>

</p>
 <br> <br>
 <h4>14.    CANCELLATION BY YOU</h4>
<p>

<b>14.1 </b>  Once you have accepted a Ride Request you may cancel in the following circumstances;<br>
<b>• 14.1.1 </b> if the you cannot get in touch with the Rider or you cannot confirm their location (for whatever reason) - no Cancellation Charge;  <br>
<b>• 14.1.2 </b> if due to unforeseen circumstances such as traffic conditions you cannot get to a Rider location within a reasonable time period - no Cancellation Charge; and <br>
<b>• 14.1.3 </b> if the Rider does not show up at the agreed pick up location within 5 minutes of your arrival - £5 Cancellation Charge (The Charge will commence being calculated from 2 minutes after your arrival at the pick up location until this 5 minute Cancellation Charge).<br>
<b>14.2 </b>  We will facilitate the payment of all Cancellation Charges directly to you <br>

</p>
 <br> <br>
  <h4>15.   OUR RIGHTS TO END THE CONTRACT</h4>
<p>
<b>15.1   Ending the contract due to your breach</b><br>
We may cancel the contract and stop providing the Services in the following circumstances:<br>
<b>• 15.1.1 </b> where you are not eligible to receive the Services, for example because you are not resident in the United Kingdom;<br>
<b>• 15.1.2 </b> where we do not have sufficient capacity to provide the Services to you;  <br>
<b>• 15.1.3 </b> if you fail to comply with these terms in a way that has a serious effect on us;  <br>
<b>• 15.1.4 </b> you do not provide or update the documentation required in paragraph 3.5 to 3.7; or <br>
<b>• 15.1.5 </b> if we discover that you gave us incorrect information when you completed your Account Registration.  <br>

<b>15.2 Ending the contract for other reasons</b> <br>
<b>• 15.2.1 </b>  We may end this contract if an event outside our control happens which means that we cannot provide the services as expected (see paragraph 7). <br>
<b>• 15.2.2 </b>  We may also cancel the contract at any time on not less than 7 days’ written notice to you at any time. In this case we will stop providing the services, and our contract with you will end, from the end of that period. <br>

</p>
 <br> <br>
  <h4>16.   INDEMNITIES</h4>

<b>•  </b> arising out of receipt of the  Services for commercial, business or re-sale purposes;<br>
